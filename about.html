    <h1>Hey, I'm Jessica!</h1>
    <p>I'm a junior computer science student at UCLA. I do research on the Java Virtual Machine at my university, and have experience in project management. My technical breadth for my major is in philosophical logic, and I'm a former course reader for a lower-division logic class at UCLA. I also help run our school's tax club!</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I develop websites (like this one!), draw, and think about language.</p>
    <p>I made this website just to have some fun; check out my LinkedIn for more information!</p>
